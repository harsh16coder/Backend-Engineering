# Backend Error Handling and Fault Tolerance

## Introduction: The Fault Tolerant Mindset in Backend Development

Errors are an inevitable part of backend development. Developers must accept that database queries can fail, external APIs may time out, users can send bad data, and business logic might hit unexpected edge cases. The real question is not if errors will happen but how to handle them effectively. The focus should be on a fault-tolerant mindset rather than specific tools or code snippets. Backend engineers must prepare for worst-case scenarios and proactively monitor and detect errors to maintain seamless user transactions.

## Types of Errors: Logic Errors

Logic errors are common and dangerous because they don’t crash the system but produce incorrect results. For instance, in an e-commerce platform, a logic error might apply discounts twice, leading to financial losses. These errors often go unnoticed without monitoring or user feedback. Causes include misunderstanding requirements, incorrect algorithms, or unhandled edge cases. They are especially risky in payment and security-sensitive areas because they silently corrupt data.

## Types of Errors: Database Errors

Database errors can cripple backend applications that rely on databases. Key types include:

* **Connection Errors:** Occur when the backend can’t connect to the database due to network issues, overload, or connection pool exhaustion, leading to 500 errors.
* **Constraint Violations:** Result from operations violating rules (e.g., duplicate emails, invalid foreign keys), pointing to weak validation layers.
* **Query Errors:** Arise from malformed SQL queries, typos, or complex queries causing timeouts.
* **Deadlocks:** Happen when multiple operations wait on each other, halting progress.

Proper validation and structured error formatting ensure graceful handling and clear user feedback.

## Types of Errors: External Service Errors

Modern applications depend on external services such as payment gateways, authentication providers, and cloud storage. These dependencies introduce external failure points:

* **Network Issues:** Timeouts, DNS failures, or unreliable connections.
* **Authentication Errors:** Invalid or expired credentials.
* **Rate Limiting:** Services enforce request limits (HTTP 429); implement exponential backoff.
* **Service Outages:** Downtime due to incidents or maintenance; use caching or redundant nodes as fallbacks.

## Types of Errors: Input Validation Errors

Input validation errors occur when user data doesn’t meet expected formats or rules. Validation defends against bad or malicious input via:

* **Format Validation:** Ensure proper email, phone, or date formats.
* **Range Validation:** Define min/max limits for numeric or string data.
* **Required Field Validation:** Enforce mandatory fields.

Typically result in 400 Bad Request responses. These errors are predictable and easier to handle than logic or service errors.

## Types of Errors: Configuration Errors

Configuration errors occur due to missing or incorrect environment variables or inconsistent setups between environments. Example: missing an API key in production. Best practice is **startup validation** — verify required configurations before the app runs, and fail fast if anything is missing. This prevents runtime 500 errors and faulty states.

---

## Prevention: Proactive Error Detection and Health Checks

The best error handling is preventive. Strategies include:

* **Health Checks:** Expose endpoints that return system health statuses.
* **Database Health Checks:** Test connectivity and query performance.
* **External Service Health Checks:** Send test requests to verify third-party integrations.
* **Core Functionality Checks:** Validate configuration loading, cache population, and data structure consistency.

Proactive detection allows fixing issues before users are impacted.

## Monitoring and Observability

Monitoring and observability are vital for early detection and diagnosis:

* Track error rates across requests, databases, and services.
* Monitor performance metrics — response times, resource usage, throughput.
* Detect degradation early as a failure warning.
* Use **structured logging** (e.g., JSON) for better metadata and tool integration (Grafana, Loki).

A dedicated video covers monitoring tools, but the mindset of **continuous observability** is emphasized here.

## Philosophies: Immediate Error Response and Recovery Strategies

Immediate responses to errors determine if issues escalate or stay contained.

* **Recoverable Errors:** Temporary issues (e.g., DB connection exhaustion) can be retried with exponential backoff.
* **Non-Recoverable Errors:** Require containment and graceful degradation — disable non-essential features or switch to fallback paths.

**Recovery Strategies:**

* **Automatic:** Restart services, clean caches, or switch to backups.
* **Manual:** Human intervention with documented recovery procedures.

Preserve **data integrity** via backups, transaction logs, and recovery tools.

---

## Propagation Control and Error Boundaries

Not every error should be handled immediately. Some need to propagate upward for more context. Use structured error handling (try/catch, error returns) for controlled bubbling.

**Error Boundaries:**

* Isolate services/processes.
* Implement timeouts and circuit breakers.
* Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication to decouple components and isolate failures.

---

## Global Error Handling: The Final Safety Net

A **global error handler** is a centralized safety net that catches all errors.

**Advantages:**

* **Robustness:** Ensures no unhandled errors.
* **Reduced Redundancy:** Avoids repetitive error handling across components.

**Example (Book Management API):**

* Validation errors → 400 Bad Request with clear messages.
* Duplicate records → 400 with descriptive messages.
* Missing records → 404 Not Found.
* Invalid references → 404 Not Found.

The global handler maps error types to proper HTTP codes and formats standardized responses.

## Security Considerations in Error Handling

Error handling must protect both platform and user data:

* Don’t expose internal details (e.g., table names, stack traces) in responses.
* Use generic messages (e.g., “Something went wrong”) for unexpected errors.
* Avoid disclosing user existence in authentication (use “Invalid email or password”).
* Log sensitive data sparingly — never log passwords, cards, or API keys.
* Use anonymized IDs and correlation IDs for tracing.
* Recognize that logs may be stored externally; minimize data exposure risks.

## Conclusion

Building fault-tolerant backend systems is about mindset — embracing error detection, prevention, handling, and recovery. While this framework is theoretical, it provides a foundation for proactive detection, global handling, observability, and secure error management.
